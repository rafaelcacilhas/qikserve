This is a small app I made for a job interview. It took ~8h spread in four days.

It could be improved a lot.  I did not implement a "remove from cart" 
or "edit" cart; I didn't want to spend more time on it so I just allowed the 
software to overwrite a new value. 

# First day
Learned to deploy the API, started the architecture

## Second day
Home page and cart logic

### Third day (saturday)
Finished the Cart page and made a quick User page.
Fixed a bug when adding the same item on the cart

## Fourth day 
Did the CartItem component and all the calculations related to the price
Solved all bugs
